Coming into the final fortnight of the project, the work is going along at a gradual pace.

I have made some progress on the resolver implementation, albeit _much_ less that I would have liked to. Progress has mostly been hampered by 2 things, the codebase being fairly more entangled than I had initially judged it to be and I had an unexpected dip in work hours over last 2 weeks due to my university changing the academic pattern for the year without any sort of prior notice, which completely messed up my plans. 

## What next?

Coming into the final stretch of the project, I've some code written down and have a bunch of ideas but nothing has been completely implemented yet. Some of the unforeseen obstacles (like InstallRequirement and PackageFinder containing some logic relevant to resolution of packages ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ, college faculty giving too many assignments) have been mostly overcome and the resolver implementation is underway.

None the less, in the coming week I expect to, at least, have a WIP PR that has an implementation of the resolver; with separate PRs for all the other changes it depends on.

PS: I've eaten up my 2 buffer weeks so, well, there's that.
